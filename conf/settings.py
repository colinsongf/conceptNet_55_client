    # We had to make a decision here on Norwegian. Norwegian Bokm책l ('nb') and
    # Nynorsk ('nn') have somewhat different vocabularies but are mutually
    # intelligible. Informal variants of Norwegian, especially when spoken,
    # don't really distinguish them. Some Wiktionary entries don't distinguish
    # them either. And the CLDR data puts them both in the same macrolanguage
    # of Norwegian ('no').
    #
    # The catch is, Bokm책l and Danish are *more* mutually intelligible than
    # Bokm책l and Nynorsk, so maybe they should be the same language too. But
    # Nynorsk and Danish are less mutually intelligible.
    #
    # There is no language code that includes both Danish and Nynorsk, so
    # it would probably be inappropriate to group them all together. We will
    # take the easy route of making the language boundaries correspond to the
    # national boundaries, and say that 'nn' and 'nb' are both kinds of 'no'.

a python web api client for conceptnet5 , mainly for Chinese commonsense query and study.

a wonderful commonsense knowledge base called concenptnet(http://conceptnet.io/) is now released new version ,and their REST API changed a lot. 
I lanched this repo based on some online code and modified, improved, refined for  the MIT conceptnet lastest version. 
thanks for their work, I can now get further.

You can simply change to your intested language commonsens.

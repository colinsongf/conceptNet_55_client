# conceptNet_55_client
a python  client for conceptnet5.5 REST API , mainly for Chinese commonsense query and study.

a great commonsense knowledge base called concenptnet(http://conceptnet.io/) is now released new version 5.5 ,and their REST API changed a lot from old one. 

I lanched this repo based on some online code , but I modified, improved, refined  it for  the MIT conceptnet lastest version. 

thanks for their work, I can now go further.

You can simply change to your intested language commonsens and do more ,go further.

require python >=3.5, conceptnet >=5.5
